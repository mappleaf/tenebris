tenebris=Tenebris

[space-location-description]
tenebris=A mysterious, dark planet, perpetually cloaked in shadow due to its thick, light-absorbing atmosphere. The surface is sparsely illuminated by bioluminescent flora and fauna that thrive in the absence of sunlight, casting faint glows across a landscape tinted with purples and deep blues. Tenebris is a harsh, enigmatic world, where technology and light are essential for survival amidst the perpetual gloom.

luciferin=A bioluminescent powder that emits a soft blue-green glow, used for advanced energy and light-based applications.
lucifunnel=A bioluminescent plant with delicate, funnel-shaped leaves that emit an ethereal blue-green glow. Its curling tendrils and intricate leaf patterns create a mesmerizing display in the darkness, reminiscent of underwater coral or alien flora. The Lucifunnel thrives in low-light environments, where it radiates a soft, ghostly light, attracting nocturnal pollinators and illuminating its surroundings with a mystical aura.
lucifunnel-seed=A rare, luminous seed emitting a soft blue-green glow, essential for cultivating bioluminescent flora.
quartz-ore=A shiny, crystal-like mineral found in rugged, earthy deposits, valued for crafting and industrial uses.
quartz-crystal=A clear, glassy mineral with sharp facets, valued for its beauty and durability in crafting and industry.
chitin=A tough, layered material from exoskeletons, known for its resilience and durability.
tenecap=A dull brown mushroom.
tenecap-spore=A small bundle of spores, harvested from the Tenecap mushroom.
chitosan=A refined, lightweight material derived from chitin, known for its flexibility and durability.
biobeacon=Beacon infused with bioluminescent power, accepts all modules, including [item=quality-module].

[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
tenebris-briefing=[planet=tenebris] is a planet enshrouded in eternal darkness, solar is useless here and night vision won't work either. The planet is infested with centipedes, they are strong and poisonous, but will not bother you unless you get in their way. The planet is powered by [item=luciferin], a compound which allows the creation of bioluminescent machinery, which does not need any power to operate. Cargo pods may experience navigation failures trying to land on this planet, maybe we can use the technology we research here to circumvent that?\n\nYou will need to make use of the [entity=bioinfusor] to bioinfuse machinery with bioluminescent properties, which allows them to function without needing power.
